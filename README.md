Deployment Part 1 (Read Carefully)
If you want to run this node on a separate VPS & if you already tried to run this node on that separate VPS, you need to delete docker container files using below mentioned commands

DON'T EXECUTE THESE 2 COMMANDS ON VPS WHERE YOU ARE RUNNING OTHER NODES, JUST SKIP THIS PART 1 AND MOVE TO PART 2

docker stop $(docker ps -aq) && docker rm $(docker ps -aq) && docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q);docker system prune --volumes -a -f
Deployment Part 2
 Allora.Node.1.mp4 
Open termius/putty terminal
Paste these 2 commands one by one
rm -rf allora.sh allora-chain/ basic-coin-prediction-node/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dxzenith/allora-worker-node/main/allora.sh && chmod +x allora.sh && ./allora.sh
In the middle of the command execution, it will ask for keyring phrase, Here you need write a password (example : 12345678)
During pasting HEAD_ID , Don't use Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste, instead just select the whole KEY_ID and Press Right Click
Check Node Status
Execute the below command to check whether your node is running or not

  curl --location 'http://localhost:6000/api/v1/functions/execute' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "function_id": "bafybeigpiwl3o73zvvl6dxdqu7zqcub5mhg65jiky2xqb4rdhfmikswzqm",
    "method": "allora-inference-function.wasm",
    "parameters": null,
    "topic": "1",
    "config": {
        "env_vars": [
            {
                "name": "BLS_REQUEST_PATH",
                "value": "/api"
            },
            {
                "name": "ALLORA_ARG_PARAMS",
                "value": "ETH"
            }
        ],
        "number_of_nodes": -1,
        "timeout": 2
    }
}'
You will see a response like this :

{"code":"200","request_id":"876a58bf-2cad-49ff-a722-86a5da444528","results":[{"result":{"stdout":"{\"infererValue\": \"2908.09263675852\"}\n\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0},"peers":["12D3KooWM99J9Qc9QhsBXiezdJKr9Y6MJN3LDL8XfcBDbCn1qtAp"],"frequency":100}],"cluster":{"peers":["12D3KooWM99J9Qc9QhsBXiezdJKr9Y6MJN3LDL8XfcBDbCn1qtAp"]}}
It means your node is working fine âœ…
